# ⚠ THE TUNNEL IS NOT A CONVENIENCE, IT IS THE ONLY WAY IN.
# The security list opens exactly one inbound port: SSH. The Kubernetes API on 6443 is NOT
# reachable from your laptop, deliberately — exposing a control plane to the internet is a
# bad trade for saving one flag. So kubectl talks to 127.0.0.1:6443 and this script forwards
# that down the SSH connection.
#
# This is also why the kubeconfig is used AS FETCHED, with its `server: https://127.0.0.1:6443`
# intact. An earlier version rewrote it to the public IP, which could not work: the port is
# closed, and k3s's API certificate carries a 127.0.0.1 SAN rather than the public address,
# so even an open port would have failed TLS verification. (Reported as #9.)
