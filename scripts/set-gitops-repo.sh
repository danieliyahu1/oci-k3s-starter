# Point Argo CD at a different repo, without hand-editing a live object.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (#13). gitops_repo_url is baked into cloud-init, which runs once at first
# boot, so changing it in terraform.tfvars does nothing to a running box. The old advice was
# `kubectl patch application root --type=merge -p '{...}'` over SSH — JSON quoting that is
# easy to mangle, on the wrong machine, and forgotten by morning.
#
# The bootstrap now re-applies /etc/k3s-starter/root-application.yaml on EVERY run, so that
# file is the source of truth on the box. This edits it and kicks the timer.
#
# IT ALSO EDITS THE CHILD APPLICATIONS IN THIS CHECKOUT. Some Applications under
# kubernetes/ source this repo themselves (the dashboard, the cloudflared secret), and
# they carry their own repoURL. Pointing only the root app at your fork leaves them
# pulling from upstream: your edits never deploy, and upstream pushes keep syncing into
# your cluster with prune enabled. They are files in git — Argo's selfHeal would revert
# a live patch within minutes — so the fix is made here and takes effect when you push.
