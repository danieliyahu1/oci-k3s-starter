# The kubeconfig is therefore used AS FETCHED, keeping `server: https://127.0.0.1:6443`. An
# earlier version rewrote it to the public IP, which could not work: the port is closed, and
# k3s's API certificate carries a 127.0.0.1 SAN rather than the public address. (See #9.)

# Windows note: `ssh` ships with Windows 10/11 (OpenSSH client). If it is missing:
