#  RUNG 2 — real hostnames, with no inbound ports.
#
#  Everything in this file is created ONLY when enable_cloudflare = true. With it false
#  the provider is never called, no credentials are needed, and rung 1 is unaffected.
#
#  HOW IT WORKS, because it is the opposite of the usual arrangement: a connector pod
#  inside the cluster dials OUT to Cloudflare and holds that connection open. Requests
#  arrive at Cloudflare's edge and are handed back down it. Nothing listens on the public
#  internet — the security list still has exactly one inbound rule, for SSH.
#
#      browser → Cloudflare edge → (tunnel, outbound-established) → cloudflared → Service
#
#  Compare with opening 443: an ingress controller, a certificate, a DNS-01 solver, a
#  renewal that fails silently at 3am, and a listening port. This is fewer moving parts
#  AND a smaller attack surface, which is not a trade you get often.
